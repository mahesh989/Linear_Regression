# Project Overview
42 people with early Parkinson's disease (PPD) were used in this experiment to collect voice measures and demographic data for the "po2_data.csv" dataset. The dataset is separate from the first dataset and is only available to PPD participants. A different set of attributes that were taken out of speech samples correlate to each record. Age, gender, test time, and voice-related measures including jitter, shimmer, RPDE, DFA, and PPE are all included in the dataset. A thorough assessment of motor symptoms and total impairment status in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease is provided by the inclusion of Motor UPDRS scores (ranging from 0 to 108) and Total UPDRS scores (ranging from 0 to 176).

The two main goals of this project are to predict the Total UPDRS score for a thorough assessment of overall disability in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease and the Motor UPDRS score for a precise assessment of motor symptoms. For better patient outcomes, these goals seek to improve clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and disease management.
